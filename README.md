## Project Idea
We quantized different musical notes and created a superposition of them, and then exploited the properties of quantum mechanics to generate different patterns and hence different genre of music.
## Description
The Quantum Music Composer application used a quantum simulator to compose music. The musical composition consisted of a series of quantum circuits. At multiple points we used quantum random number generators using quantum circuits. We have used superposition states which generate notes with a known probability. We have designed the functions using Qiskit in this [folder](https://github.com/jezerjojo14/QuantumMusicComposer/blob/main/composerapp/quantum_program.py) and called it these in our views directory of django app. This project is made using Django framework to connect the Qiskit to our website.

Our works are basically focussed towards musical expression and we classified it into six parts.
* Happy
* Emotional
* Uplifting
* Sad
* Evil
* Sinister

In addition to that we have created a random music which possibly use all the chord progressions, beat patterns and melodies that we have generated in a random fashion.
